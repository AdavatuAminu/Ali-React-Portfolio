                <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Hi, I’m <span className="font-semibold text-indigo-600">Aliyu Aminu Adavatu</span> — a passionate Frontend Developer based in Kaduna, Nigeria.
                    My journey into tech began with a strong curiosity for building things that people interact with daily.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    I specialize in creating intuitive and responsive web interfaces using technologies like <strong>React.js</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. With a strong foundation in <strong>UI/UX design</strong> and <strong>graphic design</strong>, I focus on building products that are not just functional but also visually compelling and user-centric.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    Over the past few months, I’ve worked as an intern, volunteer, and freelancer—contributing to multiple frontend projects and collaborating with cross-functional teams. I enjoy solving real-world problems, enhancing user experiences, and constantly exploring new tools and design systems to stay ahead in the fast-paced web ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    In addition to frontend development, I have hands-on experience in creating branding materials, layouts, and visual assets using tools like <strong>Figma</strong> and <strong>Adobe Creative Suite</strong>. This creative background enhances my approach to building clean and consistent UI components.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy reading tech blogs, designing interfaces, or brainstorming innovative ideas that can make a positive impact locally and globally. I’m currently open to <span className="font-semibold">remote opportunities, internships, and full-time roles</span> where I can grow, contribute, and collaborate with passionate teams.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
                    I hold a degree in Urban and Regional Planning from the Federal University of Technology, Minna. Driven by a growing passion for technology, I have since earned certifications in <strong>Frontend Development</strong>, <strong>Software Engineering</strong>, <strong>Graphic Design</strong>, and <strong>UI/UX Design</strong>.
